#  Notes on Parallel Computing

This repository contains my comprehensive **Parallel Computing Notes** written in LaTeX as part of my coursework for Introduction to Scalable Systems and Parallel Programming at Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore.  
It serves as both a study reference and a practical resource for students, researchers, and professionals especially from non-CS background working in **High Performance Computing (HPC)**, **MPI**, **OpenMP**, **CUDA**, and related parallel programming paradigms.
